## SQL Injection Mitigation Project

This hands-on project shows how I identified and fixed a classic SQL Injection vulnerability in DVWA's `low.php`. I reproduced the vulnerability on a VPS server, connected from my Kali Linux VM, and secured the input using **prepared statements** and **type validation**.

This project is part of my personal cybersecurity lab and portfolio.
